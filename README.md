# SQL-Challenge: Module 9

## Content
Within this module's Repository, I've included the full SQL script in the main, and all the output queries in a subfolder "outputs". The names of each query are sequenced as outlined in the module's instructions and also correspond to the code in the full script. I've also included a basic Jupyter file I used to help myself mentally map the process. 


## Background Story
This Module was fairly challenging for me. I ended up missing the majority of the classes covering this topic due to the birth of my first child. When faced with studying and applying the lesson by myself, I did end up facing some technical issues as well. The main issue was when trying to import data into a data column within pgAdmin (right clicking on "Import/Export" gives the error "Utility file not found". No useful info online to my misfortune.). As a solution, I executed the lesson using QuickDBD (for the diagram and basic table structure) and DBeaver (for the SQL coding). Both of these were mentioned by our instructor as his prefered programs. I did review my build in a tutor session with Simon Rennocks, to which he remarked my build matched the criteria given my circumstance. As far as I can tell, the final results I've provided should match the critria for the module, but my apologies if my attempted resolutions don't align with the intended results.
